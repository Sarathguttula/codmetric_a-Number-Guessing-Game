# codmetric_a-Number-Guessing-Game
This is a Python-based Number Guessing Game built as part of the Codmetric Internship (Task 2).
The program generates a random number, and the player has to guess it with feedback after each attempt.
It demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, random number generation, and error handling in Python.
